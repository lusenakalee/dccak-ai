              The Digital Content Creators Association of Kenya (DCCAK) is the first legally recognized and nationally
              mandated professional body for digital content creators in Kenya—and a pioneering force on the African
              continent.
            </p>

            <p>
              Founded in February 2024, DCCAK exists to organize, advocate for, and professionalize the work of digital
              storytellers who use platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, blogs, podcasts, Facebook, and streaming
              services to share ideas, entertain, educate, and influence society.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are a non-profit, membership-based association representing creators from every county, genre, and
              platform—ranging from comedy and commentary to education, health, advocacy, tech, fashion, and more. Our
              mandate is to build a thriving and inclusive creative economy where content creation is recognized not
              only as a legitimate career, but as a powerful driver of youth employment, civic participation, national
              identity, and social impact.
            </p>

            <p>
              At DCCAK, we believe content creation is more than entertainment—it is a form of leadership, a vehicle for
              development, and a cornerstone of Kenya's digital future.
